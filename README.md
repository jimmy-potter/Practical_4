This repository contains all the files needed to reproduce our group's work on Practical 4.

Running the code in SwingyBasic.py will reproduce our basic model for teaching the Monkey to swing. The code will run 500 epochs at a fast speed. This solution involved a basic binning of the state space along with a Q-Function update algorithm.

Running the code in SwingyFinal.py will reproduce our final model for teaching the Monkey to swing. Like the above code, it will run 500 epochs at a fast speed. This final model involves many improvements to our basic model, which are detailed in our project writeup.
